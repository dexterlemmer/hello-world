Github Hello world from https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

## Description
I've used version control (including GitHub) before. However, I've never had a good workflow. I'm working on changing that. So... let's start with Hello-World! Frankly, you probably don't care. May I suggest you go visit some other repo of mine. Or may be someone else's. ;-)
